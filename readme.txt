== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can redirect all media files? =

No, it depends on the rule you want to create. For example, you can redirect an image to another image, but not image to audio or video. WordPress uses different ways to load images, we can't manage HTML output for it. However, redirects from a video or audio file to an image can be done, whenever you use the shortcode that WordPress provides.
